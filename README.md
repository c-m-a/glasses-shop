# HTML & CSS capstone project: Glasses shop [LIVE](https://cma4c.github.io/glasses-shop/docs/)

## Description.

[![Glasses Shop](https://github.com/cma4c/glasses-shop/blob/features/img/glasses-shop-index.png?raw=true)](https://cma4c.github.io/glasses-shop/docs/)

This project is based on an online
[shop for sneakers](https://www.behance.net/gallery/80392909/AXEL-ARIGATO-Website).
I followed the design of the website, however I personalised the content to an 
online glasses shop.

For this project I used [BEM](http://getbem.com) for naming convention and I
a [specificity tool](https://jonassebastianohlsson.com/specificity-graph/)
to make the CSS file more eficient when the browser loads the site's styles
sheets.
